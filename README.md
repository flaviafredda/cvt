# CommunityValueToken

## Overview
This repository contains the Solidity smart contracts for two unique Ethereum-based tokens: Community Value Token (CVT) and SoulBound Token (SBT). These contracts leverage the ERC20 and ERC721 standards, respectively, to create a novel ecosystem where token transferability is intertwined with community membership and exclusivity. The CVT allows transactions within a community of SBT holders, ensuring a controlled and exclusive token circulation among verified members.

## Features
- utilizes the flexibility and standards of ERC20 and ERC721 tokens to implement a dual-token system
- CVT can only be transferred among holders of the SBT, ensuring a controlled circulation within a community
- SBTs are permanently locked to the owner's wallet, serving as an immutable marker of community membership or achievement.
- SBT minting is controlled by the contract's owner, allowing for regulated issuance based on predefined criteria.

## Peculiarities
- Please remember to replace the SBT's address in CVT implementation with your own
